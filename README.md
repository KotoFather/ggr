get_google_results

The code makes use of the requests library to send a GET request to the Google API endpoint, passing in the search query, API key, and Custom Search Engine ID as parameters. The get_google_results function retrieves the JSON response from the API and returns it as a Python dictionary.

The main function prompts the user to enter a search query, calls the get_google_results function, and prints the brief description of the top search result from the JSON response.

To use this code, you will need to obtain your own API key and Custom Search Engine ID from the Google Developers platform.
